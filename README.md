# challenge_13
## Project Overview
Predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, created a binary classification model using a deep neural network.
---

## Technologies

The application is in python and is uing the following libraries:



* [pandas](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html) - For data analysis.

* [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - Used for machine learning

* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)- Has many features. Used for Kmeans, PCA adn StandardScaler for this assignment. 


The operating system used in creating the application is Windows 10 64 bit. The application that used to code in notebook is Colab and then tested in Gitbash and Terminal. 

I created a engine for the application

The output file was read by:

```python
applicant_data_df = pd.read_csv(("applicants_data.csv"))
```

## Installation Guide

1. Open Gitbach or terminal and go ito the folder where you want to place the files.
2. Click on the blue "code" button which will allow you to clone.![<Code button in Github>]()
3. Then click on SSH or HTTPS as a clone method depending on if you have the SSH key setup. You will copy the link. You will then type "git clone" in Gitback or Terminal. Then paste the ssh or https information and press enter.
4. Next type "git pull" command in Temrinal or GitBash to pull the repository from the remote Github repository to a local directory on your computer.
5. You have access to the application. Also there will be all the python files that the application is depended on,  plus the excel file.

## Usage

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables:
    Preprocess data for a neural network model.
    Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
    Optimize the model.
